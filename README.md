cloudify-nodecellar-singlehost
==============================

A sample Cloudify 3 blueprint that simulates two hosts and installs a sample nodejs+mongodb application. Effectivelly all of the components are installed on the same host as the Cloudify manager. The sample nodejs application used here is [nodecellar](http://coenraets.org/blog/2012/10/nodecellar-sample-application-with-backbone-js-twitter-bootstrap-node-js-express-and-mongodb/), but it could have been any other application for that matter.
